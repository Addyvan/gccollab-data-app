 This application gives users a web interface for retrieving statistics on their groups.
 Web visualizations are created using C3. Front end is built on React. Back end runs on Node.js with calls to Python scripts for data gathering / munging.

Statistics are currently limited to groups, however support for many other types of pages and content is planned.

This project is currently a work in progress.
